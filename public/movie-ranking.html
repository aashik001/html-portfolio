<h1>The Best Movies According to Amisatoshi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Akira</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime/manga film that introduced me to the genre.</p>

<h3>The Godfather Part 2</h3>
<p>The best gangster movie of all time. The second movie in the trilogy is the best one, featuring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.</p>

<h3>Bladerunner - The Final Cut</h3>
<p>The OG cyberpunk movie of all time. This particular version is the best version after the director's cut.</p>
